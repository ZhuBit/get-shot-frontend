# Get-Shot
## Overview
Get-Shot is a two-part project aimed at facilitating process management for vaccine shots. It consists of a frontend built with React and a backend developed using Python Flask. This project is part of a course focused on process management.

## Repositories
Frontend (get-shot-frontend): A React-based frontend offering a user-friendly interface for managing vaccine appointments and tracking.
Backend (get-shot-backend): A Python Flask backend that processes, stores data, and interfaces with the frontend.

### Features
**Appointment Scheduling:** Users can schedule vaccine shots through the interface.
**Process Tracking:** The system tracks the entire process of vaccine administration.
**Data Management:** Secure and efficient user and vaccine information handling.
**Real-time Updates:** Keeps users informed with the latest vaccine availability and appointment schedules.
**Location Tracking**: Monitors the location of vaccine distributions.
**Management**: Provides tools for managing processes, resources, and logistics related to vaccine administration.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Python
Flask
Node.js (for frontend)
npm or yarn (for frontend)
Git

* Note you will have to connect APIs to DB and frontend

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
